This repository contains the open source parts of the museum4punkt0 
AR Interactive Guide Tool project for the Ethnologisches Museum Berlin 
at the Humboldt Forum. In order to run this project, you need to add 
the closed-source third-party 
library https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/fingers-touch-gestures-for-unity-41076 
at \ar_interactive_tour_guide_unity\Assets\Fingers as instructed in 
the text file in that folder. All other third party libraries contain 
their own permissive open source licences.
